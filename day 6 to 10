# Day 6 — NumPy Basics (Core of AI/ML)

## Goal

* Handle numerical data efficiently
* Replace Python lists with NumPy arrays
* Think in vectors (ML mindset)

---

## What is NumPy?

NumPy = **fast math for AI & ML**

```python
import numpy as np
```

---

## Creating Arrays

```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
```

2D array:

```python
b = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
```

---

## Array Properties

```python
a.shape
a.ndim
a.dtype
```

---

## Basic Operations (Vectorized)

```python
a + 2
a * 3
a / 2
```

No loops needed ❌
This is why ML uses NumPy.

---

## Indexing & Slicing

```python
a[0]
a[1:3]
b[0, 1]
```

---

## Useful Functions

```python
np.sum(a)
np.mean(a)
np.max(a)
np.min(a)
```

---

## Simple ML-Style Example

```python
data = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40])
normalized = data / np.max(data)
print(normalized)
```

---

## Core Idea

ML works on **arrays, not single values**.

Python lists → NumPy arrays → ML models

* **Day 7**: Data visualization (Matplotlib)
* Then: Linear Regression from scratch 👀

Say **“Day 7”** when ready 🚀
